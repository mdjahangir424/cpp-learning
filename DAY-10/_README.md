# Testing for Equality

- The == and != operators.
- Compares the values of 2 expressions.
- Evalutes to a Boolean (True or False, 1 or 0).
- Commonly used in control flow statements.

e.g.
expr1 == expr2
expr1 != expr2
100 == 200
num1 != num2

# Relational Operators.

<pre>
- >     (Greater than).
- >=    (Greater than or Is equal to).
- <     (Less than).

# Logical Operators.

- not ! (negation).
- and && (logical and).
- or || (logical or).

# Precedence of Logical Operators.

- not has higher precedence than and.
- and has higher precedence than or.

- not is a unary operator.
- and and or are binary operators.

# Short Circuit Evaluation.

When evaluating a logical expression C++ stops as soon as the result is known.
