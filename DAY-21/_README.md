# What is a function?

# C++ Programs.

- C++ Standard Libraries (functions and classes).
- Third-party libraries (functions and classes).
- Our own functions and classes.

# Functions allow the modularization of a program.

- Seperate code into logical self-contained units.
- These units can be reused.

# What is a function?

- Write your code to the function specification.
- Understand what the function does.
- Understand what information the function needs.
- Understand what the function returns.
- Understand any errors the function may produce.
- Understand any performance constraints.

# User-Defined functions.

- We can define our own functions.
- Here is a preview.

<pre>
int sum(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

cout << sum(3,5); // 8
</pre>
