# What is a Pointer?

- A variable whose value is an address.
- What can be at that address?

  - Another variable.
  - A function.

- Pointers point to variables or functions?

- If x is an integer variable and its value is 10 then I can declare a pointer that points to it.

- To use the data that the pointer is pointing to you must know its type.
