# Expressions

- An expression is:
  - The most basic building block of a program.
  - "a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation".
  - Computes a value from a number of operands.

e.g.

<pre>
34 // literal.
favouriteNumber // variable.
1.5 + 2.8 // addition.
2 * 5 // Multiplication.
a > b // relational.
a = b // assignment.
</pre>

# Statements

- A statement is:
  - A complete line of code that performs some action.
  - Usually terminated with a semi-colon.
  - Usually contain expressions.
  - C++ has many types of statements.
    - Expression, null, compound, selection, iteration, declaration, jump, try blocks, and others.

e.g.

<pre>
int x;	// declaration
favouriteNumber = 12; // assignment.
1.5 + 2.8; // expression.
x = 2 * 5; // assignment.
if (a > b) cout << "A is greater than b"; // if
</pre>

# Operators

  - unary, binary, ternary.

- Common operators can be gourped as follow:
  - assignment
  - arithmetic.
  - increment / decrement.
